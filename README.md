# 🐍 Python Course Projects

This folder contains Python projects completed for my analytics coursework, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, 
statistical inference, and regression modeling. Each project works with real-world datasets and demonstrates applied skills in 
pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Every subfolder includes a Jupyter Notebook, datasets, and a brief README explaining the project’s goals, methods, and key findings.

## 📁 Projects Included
- **Statistical Analysis & Confidence Intervals** - descriptive statistics, EDA, interval estimation, and simulation-based coverage checks  
- **Fire Damage Regression Model** - linear regression examining how distance to a fire station relates to property damage
