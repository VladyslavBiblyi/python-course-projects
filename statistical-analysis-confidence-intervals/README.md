# Statistical Analysis & Confidence Intervals

This project explores multiple real-world datasets using Python to perform descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, 
and inferential methods. The notebook includes computation and interpretation of one-sample and two-sample confidence intervals, 
as well as simulation-based empirical coverage checks.

## Datasets Used
- **Hawaiian Well-Being Index** - measures overall life satisfaction.
- **NC Births** - newborn weights categorized by maternal smoking status.
- **Pierce County Housing Data** - square footage from real estate records.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Descriptive statistics  
- Confidence interval construction  
- Simulation to evaluate coverage probability  
- Visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly  

## Tools
Python, pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
