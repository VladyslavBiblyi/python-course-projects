# Fire Damage Regression Model

This project examines the relationship between the distance to the nearest fire station and the amount of fire damage using simple linear regression. The analysis includes exploratory visualization, model fitting, interpretation of slope and correlation, and evaluation of linearity.

## Dataset Used
- **Fire Damage Dataset** – contains measurements of property damage and distance to the closest fire station.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Exploratory data visualization  
- Identifying explanatory and response variables  
- Simple linear regression modeling  
- Interpretation of regression parameters  
- Assessing assumptions of linearity  

## Tools
Python, pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Plotly, Matplotlib
